# 🧠 Diabetes Deep Learning Assistant – Collaboration Portfolio

This repository highlights my contributions to an advanced deep learning project for diabetes prediction, developed as part of a collaborative hackathon initiative.

The system integrates **deep learning models**, **AI assistants**, and **data batch analysis** to offer both individual and large-scale patient predictions, as well as a virtual assistant for diabetic support.

🛠️ I contributed mainly by:
- Improving the **DeepSeek AI assistant integration**.
- Resolving bugs during the **development and deployment phase**.
- Supporting the **presentation strategy and documentation**.

🏆 **Award**: This project earned **3rd place** in the **Hackvolution GDN-e 2025 Hackathon**, sponsored by **NTT Data**.
